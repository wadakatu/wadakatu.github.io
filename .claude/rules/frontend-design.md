# Frontend Design Rules

## Design Philosophy

This site is heavily inspired by **The Matrix** movie. All design decisions must maintain this aesthetic:

- Matrix green (`#00ff41`) as the primary accent color
- Dark background with terminal/hacker aesthetic
- Monospace fonts (JetBrains Mono)
- Matrix rain animation as background
- Glowing effects and cyber/digital feel

**Never break the Matrix world aesthetic.**

## When to use frontend-design skill

Use the `frontend-design` skill when:

- Creating new UI components or pages
- Making significant visual/styling changes
- Implementing responsive design
- Building interactive UI elements

## Workflow

1. Use `/frontend-design` skill for design implementation
2. Verify with chrome-devtools (screenshot + snapshot)
3. Iterate until design meets requirements
